						Web design is really just one expression of the skill set we will be exploring. We don’t term typography class “brochure design” so I’d argue
						we shouldn’t teach design for interaction as "web" design (even though this semester our focus will be almost exclusively on web pages).
					</p>
					<p>
						The skills we are learning are equally applicable to other applications many of which represent huge growth industries for graphic designers
						at present. I’m referring to things like mobile app design, kiosk interface (a kiosk is a purpose-built computer such as an ATM, an information
						kiosk, the check-in station at the airport, or a self-serve check out at the supermarket), computer game design, eBook design, and many more
						applications, some probably as yet unimagined! After all, in the fast-moving world of graphic design, interface design is indisputably the fastest
						part of all. Rapidly changing technologies are forcing our design patterns to respond evolving equally rapidly. The mechanics and tools of
						creation are constantly becoming obsolete as they are replaced by new tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						This presents us with a problem. Do we teach you to use a tool that may be useless within a few years, like we saw with the rise & fall of
						Flash™?

					<p>The 'how' will always be changing and, in practice, may not even fall into the job description of the designer, but be the duty of the developer or another team member</p>

					<h3>H3 Text</h3>
					<p>
						But 'what & why', these are questions for designers, and these are far more change proof. What we are getting at now is not so susceptible to
						fashion or new technology, but rather, it is something that sits alongside our other universal design principles like composition & colour.

					<ul>
						<li>Good user-centred design for interaction is at the heart of designing for all new media, and it will not date and it will never be superseded.</li>
						<li>
							As if to prove it’s timeless credentials the design principles of designing for user interaction predate computer interfaces.As much as has been learned about interaction design in the digital age, the basic principles were already laid
							down by groundbreaking architects & industrial designers centuries before.
						</li>
						<li>
							Let’s take a look at some examples from outside of web design to illustrate this thought. I’m going to use this opportunity to vent some of my small daily frustrations with you. This may sound like an indulgence, but stay with me. I have always found that negative examples, as well as positive ones, can really help us come to a better relationship with good design.
