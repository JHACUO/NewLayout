					<h1>1.8 Support Services (academic counselling, LIL, ASU)</h1>
					<p>
						Studying is rewarding and worthwhile, but sometimes you may need help. ACU Onlineâ€™s student services can help you navigate your way
						through some of the more challenging parts of uni life. There is a range of services available to you at ACU Online. Please contact them for
						support as you progress through the unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are experiencing difficulties with learning, life issues or pastoral/spiritual concerns, or have a disability/medical condition which may
						impact on your studies, you are advised to notify your Online Facilitator (OF), Lecturer in Charge (LiC) and/or one of the services listed below
						as soon as possible.
					</p>
					<h2>Counselling services</h2>
					<p>
						Speak confidentially and freely to ACU Online's counsellors. They will listen to your circumstances and work with you to explore possible
						ways forward. Visit the Counselling page in the Student Portal to book an appointment with a counsellor, ask a counsellor a question or
						access the out-of-hours mental health crisis line.
					</p>
					<h2>Academic Integrity Module (AIM)</h2>
					<p>
						Academic integrity is the responsibility of all students and staff at ACU Online. All ACU Online students need to complete the Academic Integrity Module (AIM) in their first study period. You will be given access to the AIM in Canvas on enrolment. Your final results will not be released
						until you complete it. If you have any concerns about academic integrity, you can contact your LiC or Online Facilitator. Alternatively, the Academic Integrity team can be contacted at academic.integrity@acu.edu.au
					</p>
					<h2>Academic Skills Unit</h2>
					<p>
						As an ACU Online student, you have access to the Academic Skills Unit. The unit offers you current skills development assistance and opportunities in the areas of Academic Language and Learning, and Maths and Numeracy. You can attend workshops, drop-in sessions, ask an
						advisor online or make an appointment for an individual consultation. See the Launch Into Learning unit for more information. You can also
						self-enrol in the Academic Skills Unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also use the ASU appointment system (ACU, n.d.) to book a 30-minute consultation with an Academic Skills Advisor. A booking confirmation will be sent to your ACU Online email address. If you have any difficulties booking an appointment, contact us by email at academicskills@acu.edu.au.
					</p>
					<h2>Student Support Unit</h2>
					<p>
						A separate unit for student support has been created and you have been enrolled in it automatically. It contains key information, resources
						and contacts that you may need as you complete this unit and others in your course. You can view the Student Support module in Canvas.
					</p>
					<h2>Getting help: ASK ACUO</h2>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about the technical requirements, your hardware while studying with ACU Online, or anything related to getting you
						started and set up on your studying journey, we have a dedicated team available to help you.
