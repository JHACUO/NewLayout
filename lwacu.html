						1.7 Learning With ACU Online (operational information on
						how to use Canvas, where to find things etc.)
					</h1>
					<p>
						Since you are studying with ACU Online, there are a few things we have included here to help get you oriented with your unit and the expectations of what it means to be a student. Due to the fully online nature of units at ACU Online, most elements of your unit are asynchronous
						and will always be available throughout the teaching period. The following sections can help you make sure you know what these are and
						how to access them.
					</p>


					<hr>


					<h2>Navigating this unit</h2>
					<p>Your learning materials can be found in the Modules item in the left-hand menu. From here, you can look through the Welcome module before progressing to your weekly material. Each page in your Modules will have a ‘Next’ button at the bottom of the page, which you can use to click 	through the material.</p>
					<h3>Assessments</h3>
					<p>
						Assessments are a big part of your experience at ACU Online and they are integral to the completion of the units that make up your course.
						Assessments allow teaching staff to evaluate your performance and ascertain the extent to which you have met the prescribed learning outcomes. Assessments also allow you a way to monitor your progress as you work your way through the unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a range of services available to you which assist with support and resources and contribute to your skills in completing the assessment tasks. You can view these services in the Assessments home page or via the individual assessment items within the Assessments tab
						on the navigation menu.
					</p>

					<h3>Announcements</h3>
					</p>Announcements are the main way that you will receive information about this unit from your Online Facilitator (OF). As well as there being a
					left-hand navigation item for Announcements, each time the OF posts an Announcement to you and your peers, you will receive an automatic
					email through your Canvas inbox.</p>
					<p>
						Any Announcements posted are directed to the audience of you and your peer group. They are not used for one-on-one communication.
					</p>
					<h3>Reading List</h3>
					<p>Leganto is a comprehensive, dynamic reading list tool, which allows you to access library resources such as journal articles and books/ebooks, digitised book chapters, as well as freely available online content. You will find the link to the Leganto readings for this unit in the sidebar under the title Reading List. This is referred to throughout your weekly content.</p>
					<h3>Discussions</h3>
					<p>As part of your weekly learning material, there are opportunities provided for you to connect and have discussions with your peers. You can access the Discussions sequentially as you work through the weeks or through the Discussion item in the navigation menu.</p>
					<p[>
						DLDs remove if not using General Discussion]
						If you have a question about the general nature about this unit, you can share it with your OF
						and your peers in the General discussion board.</p>
						<h3>Respectful online interactions</h3>
						<p>
							During your online experience, it is likely you will be interacting with either your peers or your OF or both. It is important that while you interact
							with others online, you maintain respect and care during the discussions. The following principles are the standards expected of you as an
							active member of our online community:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Help each other out – ask questions and respond to others.</li>
							<li>Communicating online takes practice – start small and practice your skills.</li>
							<li>Be as clear as possible when you are writing to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
							<li>Be open to the views of others.</li>
							<li>Be sensitive to diversity and cultural differences.</li>
							<li>Be respectful when having a different opinion.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Academic Integrity Module (AIM)</h3>
						<p>
							Academic integrity is the responsibility of all students and staff at ACU Online. All ACU Online students need to complete the Academic Integrity Module (AIM) in their first study period. You will be given access to the AIM in Canvas on enrolment. Your final results will not be released
							until you complete it. If you have any concerns about academic integrity, you can contact your LiC or Online Facilitator. Alternatively, the Academic Integrity team can be contacted at academic.integrity@acu.edu.au

							a link for the Career and Employability (Students) page. The advisors are keen to provide support for postgraduate students (particularly
							online students).

							break. As an online student, you still have access to these services. See the Student Life page for more information on what is available to you.</p>
