					<p><strong>GA6:</strong> Solve problems in a variety of settings taking local and international perspectives into account.</p>

					<p><strong>GA8:</strong> Locate, organise, analyse, synthesise and evaluate information.</p>

					<p><strong>GA10: </strong>Utilise information and communication and other relevant technologies effectively.</p>
