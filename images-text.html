<p>Web design is really just one expression of the skill set we will be exploring. We don’t term typography class “brochure design” so I’d argue
we shouldn’t teach design for interaction as "web" design (even though this semester our focus will be almost exclusively on web pages).</p>

<p>The skills we are learning are equally applicable to other applications many of which represent huge growth industries for graphic designers
at present. I’m referring to things like mobile app design, kiosk interface (a kiosk is a purpose-built computer such as an ATM, an information
kiosk, the check-in station at the airport, or a self-serve check out at the supermarket), computer game design, eBook design, and many more
applications, some probably as yet unimagined! After all, in the fast-moving world of graphic design, interface design is indisputably the fastest
part of all. Rapidly changing technologies are forcing our design patterns to respond evolving equally rapidly. The mechanics and tools of creation are constantly becoming obsolete as they are replaced by new tools.</p>
<p>This presents us with a problem. Do we teach you to use a tool that may be useless within a few years, like we saw with the rise & fall of
Flash™?</p>
